        Our project is built with one simple mission: to make roads safer and
        smoother for everyone. We aim to tackle the issue of potholes by
        combining community involvement with technology. With our interactive
        map, users can view reported potholes in real-time, and even contribute
        by uploading videos of road conditions they encounter. These video
        submissions are processed using a machine learning model that analyzes
        and determines the severity of road damage. This allows for better
        decision-making, quicker repairs, and a collaborative step toward
        smarter city infrastructure. Together, let’s build smarter roads and
        stronger communities—one pothole at a time.
